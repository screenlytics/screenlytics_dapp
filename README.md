## ScreenLytics

Screenlytics is a privacy-first app that helps you understand how your attention flows across your screen time.

Instead of focusing only on totals, Screenlytics highlights patterns, sessions, and behavioral rhythms — giving context to how you actually use your device.

## ✨ What Screenlytics Does

Visualizes screen usage as patterns, not just hours

Shows attention flow across sessions and time

Highlights monthly trends and behavioral shifts

Creates a yearly Wrapped-style recap of your attention

Keeps everything calm, minimal, and distraction-free

## 🔐 Privacy First

All analysis happens locally on your device

No accounts required

No ads

No tracking

No data sold or shared

Your screen data stays yours.

## 🎯 Philosophy

Screenlytics is not about control, guilt, or productivity pressure.

It’s about awareness — understanding how small moments of attention add up over time.
